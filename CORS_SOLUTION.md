# CORS Solution for Dooray API - Dark Mode Fix

## Problem
The dark.html file was failing to make API calls to the Dooray API due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. The previous implementation was trying to pass the authentication token as a URL parameter, but the Dooray API expects proper authentication.

## Root Cause
1. **CORS Restrictions**: The Dooray API doesn't allow cross-origin requests from browsers directly
2. **Authentication Method**: Initially tried using Bearer token in Authorization header, but this causes CORS preflight issues
3. **Proxy Limitations**: Many CORS proxies don't properly forward Authorization headers

## Solution Implemented

### Multiple Fallback Methods (Priority Order):
1. **Token-Parameter-Direct**: Uses token as URL parameter with direct API call (fastest, matches working index.html)
2. **AllOrigins-Raw-Token**: Uses AllOrigins proxy with token as URL parameter
3. **CorsProxy-Token**: Uses corsproxy.io with token as URL parameter  
4. **Direct-Bearer**: Direct API call with Bearer token in Authorization header
5. **CorsProxy-Bearer**: corsproxy.io with Bearer token header
6. **AllOrigins-POST**: AllOrigins POST method with custom headers

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Method Caching**: Once a working method is found, it's cached and used first for subsequent requests
- **Progressive Fallback**: If the cached method fails, it tries all methods again
- **Rate Limit Protection**: 500ms delay between method attempts
- **Visual Status Indicator**: Shows current API connection status in top-right corner
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed logging and error messages

### API Methods Used:
```javascript
const CORS_METHODS = [
    // Token as URL parameter (most likely to work)
    'Token-Parameter-Direct',
    'AllOrigins-Raw-Token', 
    'CorsProxy-Token',
    
    // Bearer token in headers (standards-compliant but may fail due to CORS)
    'Direct-Bearer',
    'CorsProxy-Bearer',
    'AllOrigins-POST'
];
```

## Benefits
1. **High Reliability**: Multiple fallback methods ensure the app works even if some proxies are down
2. **Performance**: Caches the working method to avoid trying all methods every time
3. **User Feedback**: Visual status indicator shows connection state
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new CORS proxy methods if needed
5. **Compatibility**: Based on the working approach from index.html

## Files Modified
- `C:\Users\parksik\dooray\dark.html` - Main implementation with improved CORS handling

## Testing
The solution was designed based on analysis of the working index.html implementation and research into current CORS proxy services available in 2025.

## Usage
The dark mode application will now automatically try different CORS methods until one works, then cache that method for future use. Users will see the connection status in the top-right corner of the page.
